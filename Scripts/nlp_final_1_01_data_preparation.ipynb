Some urban areas of the city started to use ETC system for roadside parking spaces since July 1, 2019.  People s Daily Online/Li Wenming \\n\\n Thanks to the application of an artificial intelligence  AI empowered roadside electronic toll collection  ETC  system, China s capital city Beijing has seen significant improvement in the efficiency of parking fee collection, turnover of roadside parking spots, order in roadside parking, as well as traffic congestion.\\n\\n As the city further deepens its roadside parking reform, the ETC system has almost covered all the roadside parking spaces in the city, with the proportion of vehicles parked on roads using the system exceeding 90 percent.\\n\\n With the AI empowered system, drivers can park their vehicles at the parking spots on the roadside, and then pay the parking charge via their mobile phones after they drive away.\\n\\n  This road used to be full of cars, and even the normal lanes were occupied. You could hardly move a bit during the morning and  mute time,  recalled a citizen surnamed Wang, who lives in Chaoyang district of Beijing.\\n\\n  Since the summer of 2019, roadside ETC devices have been installed here. With all the cars being parked in designated parking spots on the roadside, the road now seems brighter and wider,  Wang said.\\n\\n The smart roadside ETC system  AIpark Sky Eye  adopted by Beijing is developed, operated, and maintained by AIpark, a Beijing based leading smart parking solution provider.\\n\\n  pany s intelligent system has brought into full play the advantages of AI technologies and effectively addressed the shortage of parking spaces and the problem of irregular parking in cities. The system has therefore been listed among the country s innovation projects that integrate AI deeply into the real economy in 2018 by China s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology  MIIT .\\n\\n Traditional parking management equipment and monitoring devices have failed to meet the actual needs of cities due to limited application scenarios and technical capacity. There are many deficiencies in traditional parking systems. For example, magnetic devices cannot identify detailed information about vehicles; each video monitoring pile can only cover one parking spot; and manual collection of parking fees costs too much.\\n\\n Such problems don t exist in smart machines. The  AIpark Sky Eye  system boasts strong stability and high recognition rate. Besides, it can resist the interference of extreme weather conditions like rain, snow, and fog, and  plete graphic evidence based on wheel path of vehicles.\\n\\n Each set of cameras of the  AIpark Sky Eye  system can monitor multiple parking spots at the same time for 24 hours a day. The data collected by front end cameras are processed using multi dimensional deep learning algorithm before they are uploaded on to an  puting cloud platform for data enrichment. The platform then distributes identification results to transport authorities.\\n\\n The most distinctive innovation in the technological package of the system is precision brought about by high mounted parking system cameras, according to Xiang Yanping, senior vice president of AIpark, noting that the cameras can recognize  plex static and dynamic reality scenes.\\n\\n  For example, the equipment can accurately identify irregular parking behaviors and state such as double parking and frequent maneuvers, precisely recognize detailed information including plate number and vehicle color, and make good judgment on the behaviors of drivers and pedestrians,  Xiang said.\\n\\n Once the high mounted parking system cameras are installed, they can help with many aspects of integrated urban governance, which represents another advantage of the  AIpark Sky Eye  system.\\n\\n Besides managing parking fee collection, high mounted camera system can also provide data for traffic improvements. The snapshots obtained from the camera system can help solve problems including illegal and inappropriate parking and vehicle theft.\\n\\n So far, the smart ETC system of AIpark has been introduced into more than 20 cities in China, signaling increasingly important roles of AI in improving parking efficiency and order as well as new development opportunities for smart parking industry.\\n 1 2 3 \\nPhotos\\nNaval fleet steams in East China Sea\\nNewborn golden snub nosed monkey makes debut\\nIn pics: birds across China\\nGrain painting studio helps villagers to increase  e\\nRelated Stories\\nExhibition highlighting art science integration opens in BeijingChina s AI industry poised to enter boom timesAlibaba outlines 10 technology trends for 2019China s leading AI enterprise iFlytek to develop health information technologyCheetah Mobile wades into artificial intelligenceChina overtakes the US in investment in AI5 million artificial intelligence talents urgently needed in ChinaGraduate students give 'voice' to sign languageArtificial Intelligence in real livesMicrosoft embraces artificial intelligence\\nAbout People's Daily Online    Join Us   Contact Us\\nCopyright   2021 People's Daily Online.

       " 'The world entered a new era of accelerated transformation in the last eighteen months that will continue to evolve and press forward for years  e. Most businesses are playing catch up trying to make sense of a new timeline where the ten years that had been set aside for careful planning and implementation of what  ing up next no longer exists. The next is happening now and, regardless of your industry or seniority, the status quo has shifted and you better face it. Back in 2019, I was invited to attend a pompous meeting in London at the Brazilian Embassy along with selected leading names from the oil and energy industry, to get an update on what was going to happen in the following decade. I could soon spot all the  ing up on PowerPoint slides from the  panies presenting:  missioning, decarbonisation, zero emissions, transition to green energy. Throughout the morning and most of the afternoon, we heard that most of these changes would kick in between 2030 35. And I recall a Shell executive pointing out that the business had explicitly concluded that the current  e streams were needed to provide the capital required for the transition to take place in due course.Whomever you talk to in the energy industry in 2021 would tell you to forget about that timeline. Change  e and the transition is happening much faster than anticipated, with big businesses scrambling to find the capital to fund all that is required. I could go on all day talking about how the pandemic and the impact it had on market demand and consumer behaviour messed up the timeline of transport, automotive, defence, manufacturing and so on. For instance, carrier planes that were due to be retired in 2017 are now required to remain in service at least until 2029. Projects in wind power involving upgrades of wind farms have been scrapped and new installations have drawn  petition from up  ing brands with operators tending to favour smaller turbines   for being efficient and cheaper to run   and choosing to buy from multiple suppliers instead of just  pany. Machine learning  ML , AI and Industry 4.0 knock at the door. Still, the biggest change yet to be fully appreciated by business leaders is how electronics effectively became the brain of every industrial asset and all infrastructure equipment in operation in recent years, and therefore what is required to deal with breakdowns and obsolescence. For instance, I lost count of the many rail connections that I have working in operations and maintenance who struggle with their CME   chief mechanical engineer   who, like the role suggests, is usually a mechanically biased individual who may have a less than ideal approach when  es to the handling of electronic failures. And you guessed right: less ideal means neither green nor cheap solutions, as illustrated in this video:   Many decision makers only realise the problem at hand and regret not following the tag  RepairDontWaste on LinkedIn in times like this, resulting  ments like, \"We did not anticipate that the equipment would  e obsolete so quickly!\" or, \"Spare circuit boards started to take weeks then months to arrive. Then we were told that they would no longer be supplied. We were quoted seven figure prices to upgrade our assembly line.\"By deferring the responsibility to the original equipment supplier and other third parties, you are bound to be caught off guard soon or later. And the risk exposure from insisting on this strategy is about to get exponentially higher; there is a  ponent shortage increasing lead times, and technology providers are dropping support for many products in order to remain viable.Last month, a wind turbine multinational in the US had to ship a bunch of expensive controller cards used in inverters and speed governing systems to its workshop in Brazil for repair as new replacement cards are not due back in stock for another six months. Good job that the local team had an electronic diagnostic equipment BoardMaster from ABI in the shop, ready to help the technicians locate the fault and repair the cards, which happened in record time.Poor decision making when  es to setting maintenance and repair strategies are often linked to  fake news  and myths such as:  A repaired electronic card  PCB/PCBA  will never be as good as a new one.  The manufacturer told us that special software was required to troubleshoot the card.  Troubleshooting down to  ponent level is impossible or would take too long.  Dedicated test and repair equipment is prohibitively expensive.The mentality here needs to change, and fast. The longer you take to embrace the new strategies for in house fault analysis, maintenance, and obsolescence planning of your key electronic circuits and assets, the more expensive it will get to keep them going. Hundreds of leading organisations have found in recent years that the belief in these myths was hindering their results  promising the operation   from GE Renewable to Collins Aerospace, where the latter reduced troubleshooting times on avionics circuit cards from 50 hours to 10 minutes. Then there is Lego in Mexico, where controller cards from 600  plastic moulding machines worth tens of thousands of dollars each have been mapped and are now repaired in house. In the US, an army engineer saved a mobile shelter unit worth 10 million dollars from being  missioned by repairing its HVAC circuit board that was deemed  irreparable  by the OEM. In the rail  panies like Alstom, CAF, Bombardier and operators like Irish Rail, SFMTA, TCDD and so many others have discovered the benefits of investing in the right tool and skill development programme to shield the business against parts shortages and accelerated obsolescence. Some of their stories, and the technology that is driving several top shelf global sustainability projects, were the subject of a YouTube series called ABI Labs. The series gives an in depth review of the key tests and techniques available in the British made BoardMaster hardware and software platform from ABI Electronics to handle predictive as well as corrective maintenance of critical electronics without wasting time or money.

       " \"Chinese Japanese French Spanish Russian Arabic Korean German Portuguese Thursday, March 18, 2021 Home     Artificial intelligence improves parking efficiency in Chinese cities By Liu Shiyao  People's Daily  09:16, March 18, 2021 Photo taken on July 1, 2019, shows a sign for electronic toll collection  ETC  newly set up at a roadside parking space on Yangzhuang road, Shijingshan district, Beijing. Some urban areas of the city started to use ETC system for roadside parking spaces since July 1, 2019.  People s Daily Online/Li Wenming \",\n",
       " ' Thanks to the application of an artificial intelligence  AI empowered roadside electronic toll collection  ETC  system, China s capital city Beijing has seen significant improvement in the efficiency of parking fee collection, turnover of roadside parking spots, order in roadside parking, as well as traffic congestion.',\n",
       " ' As the city further deepens its roadside parking reform, the ETC system has almost covered all the roadside parking spaces in the city, with the proportion of vehicles parked on roads using the system exceeding 90 percent.',\n",
       " ' With the AI empowered system, drivers can park their vehicles at the parking spots on the roadside, and then pay the parking charge via their mobile phones after they drive away.',\n",
       " '  This road used to be full of cars, and even the normal lanes were occupied. You could hardly move a bit during the morning and  mute time,  recalled a citizen surnamed Wang, who lives in Chaoyang district of Beijing.',\n",
       " '  Since the summer of 2019, roadside ETC devices have been installed here. With all the cars being parked in designated parking spots on the roadside, the road now seems brighter and wider,  Wang said.',\n",
       " ' The smart roadside ETC system  AIpark Sky Eye  adopted by Beijing is developed, operated, and maintained by AIpark, a Beijing based leading smart parking solution provider.',\n",
       " '  pany s intelligent system has brought into full play the advantages of AI technologies and effectively addressed the shortage of parking spaces and the problem of irregular parking in cities. The system has therefore been listed among the country s innovation projects that integrate AI deeply into the real economy in 2018 by China s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology  MIIT .',\n",
       " ' Traditional parking management equipment and monitoring devices have failed to meet the actual needs of cities due to limited application scenarios and technical capacity. There are many deficiencies in traditional parking systems. For example, magnetic devices cannot identify detailed information about vehicles; each video monitoring pile can only cover one parking spot; and manual collection of parking fees costs too much.',\n",
       " ' Such problems don t exist in smart machines. The  AIpark Sky Eye  system boasts strong stability and high recognition rate. Besides, it can resist the interference of extreme weather conditions like rain, snow, and fog, and  plete graphic evidence based on wheel path of vehicles.',\n",
       " ' Each set of cameras of the  AIpark Sky Eye  system can monitor multiple parking spots at the same time for 24 hours a day. The data collected by front end cameras are processed using multi dimensional deep learning algorithm before they are uploaded on to an  puting cloud platform for data enrichment. The platform then distributes identification results to transport authorities.',\n",
       " ' The most distinctive innovation in the technological package of the system is precision brought about by high mounted parking system cameras, according to Xiang Yanping, senior vice president of AIpark, noting that the cameras can recognize  plex static and dynamic reality scenes.',\n",
       " '  For example, the equipment can accurately identify irregular parking behaviors and state such as double parking and frequent maneuvers, precisely recognize detailed information including plate number and vehicle color, and make good judgment on the behaviors of drivers and pedestrians,  Xiang said.',\n",
       " ' Once the high mounted parking system cameras are installed, they can help with many aspects of integrated urban governance, which represents another advantage of the  AIpark Sky Eye  system.',\n",
       " ' Besides managing parking fee collection, high mounted camera system can also provide data for traffic improvements. The snapshots obtained from the camera system can help solve problems including illegal and inappropriate parking and vehicle theft.',\n",
       " \" So far, the smart ETC system of AIpark has been introduced into more than 20 cities in China, signaling increasingly important roles of AI in improving parking efficiency and order as well as new development opportunities for smart parking industry.  1 2 3  Photos Naval fleet steams in East China Sea Newborn golden snub nosed monkey makes debut In pics: birds across China Grain painting studio helps villagers to increase  e Related Stories Exhibition highlighting art science integration opens in BeijingChina s AI industry poised to enter boom timesAlibaba outlines 10 technology trends for 2019China s leading AI enterprise iFlytek to develop health information technologyCheetah Mobile wades into artificial intelligenceChina overtakes the US in investment in AI5 million artificial intelligence talents urgently needed in ChinaGraduate students give 'voice' to sign languageArtificial Intelligence in real livesMicrosoft embraces artificial intelligence About People's Daily Online    Join Us   Contact Us Copyright   2021 People's Daily Online.
